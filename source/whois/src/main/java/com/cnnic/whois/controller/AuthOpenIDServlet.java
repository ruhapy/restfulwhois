	/**
	 * Called by the server (via the service method) to allow a servlet to
	 * handle a GET request. Overriding this method to support a GET request
	 * also automatically supports an HTTP HEAD request. A HEAD request is a GET
	 * request that returns no body in the response, only the request header
	 * fields.
	 * 
	 * When overriding this method, read the request data, write the response
	 * headers, get the response's writer or output stream object, and finally,
	 * write the response data. It's best to include content type and encoding.
	 * When using a PrintWriter object to return the response, set the content
	 * type before accessing the PrintWriter object.
	 * 
	 * The servlet container must write the headers before committing the
	 * response, because in HTTP the headers must be sent before the response
	 * body.
	 * 
	 * Where possible, set the Content-Length header (with the
	 * ServletResponse.setContentLength(int) method), to allow the servlet
	 * container to use a persistent connection to return its response to the
	 * client, improving performance. The content length is automatically set if
	 * the entire response fits inside the response buffer.
	 * 
	 * When using HTTP 1.1 chunked encoding (which means that the response has a
	 * Transfer-Encoding header), do not set the Content-Length header.
	 * 
	 * The GET method should be safe, that is, without any side effects for
	 * which users are held responsible. For example, most form queries have no
	 * side effects. If a client request is intended to change stored data, the
	 * request should use some other HTTP method.
	 * 
	 * The GET method should also be idempotent, meaning that it can be safely
	 * repeated. Sometimes making a method safe also makes it idempotent. For
	 * example, repeating queries is both safe and idempotent, but buying a
	 * product online or modifying data is neither safe nor idempotent.
	 * 
	 * If the request is incorrectly formatted, doGet returns an HTTP
	 * "Bad Request" message.
